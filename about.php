 <h1 align="center">About Us</h1><hr>
<p>   This simple project is entitled Online Discussion Forum Site. This is a web-based application project developed in PHP and MySQL Database. This simple project's main goal is to provide an online platform for an organization where they can discuss any topic that is related to the site or organization. The site allows users to post any topic under a certain topic category. Users can post comments on each posted published topic. The system user interface was developed with Bootstrap Framework and AdminLTE Framework. It also consists of user-friendly features and functionalities.<br>

About the Online Discussion Forum Site<br>
I developed this project using the following:<br>
▪️ PHP<br>
▪️ MySQL Database<br>
▪️ HTML<br>
▪️ CSS<br>
▪️ JavaScript<br>
▪️ Ajax<br>
▪️ jQuery<br>
▪️ Bootstrap<br>
▪️ Font Awesome<br>
▪️ AdminLTE<br>

This Online Discussion Forum Site is accessible to anyone and site management. As I mentioned at beginning of this article, the project allows users to post or published certain topics. Each published topic is visible to the public and registered users. The system requires the users to register and log in with their credentials to gain access to posting topics and comments. This project also contains an Admin Panel Site where the site management can manage all the data on the system. This side of the project requires an administrator user credential to gain access to the features and functionalities. On this site, the management can overwrite, and delete users' posts and comments. The admin users also can create a new topic on this site. The Admin Users are the ones who are in charge of populating the topic category list. They can also update the system name, logo, etc.
